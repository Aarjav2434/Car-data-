This COVID dataset is a daily snapshot (up to April 29, 2020) of how the pandemic unfolded around the world and within U.S. states. 

In simple terms, it lets you track and compare the spread, severity, and recovery from COVID-19 across places and over time. You can see which areas were hardest hit, when death counts started to climb or fall, and how recoveries grew—insights that help health officials, researchers, and policymakers understand trends, plan hospitals and resources, and learn which responses worked best.

I have worked with some questions and has also listed the reasons to include those questions 

# Totals by Region (confirmed, deaths, recovered):-

Usefulness :- Shows how many cases, deaths, and recoveries happened in each region. Helps health authorities see which countries need the most medical aid and support. Guides global resource allocation and international aid efforts.

# Removing rows with deaths < 10

Usefulness :- Filters out minor outbreaks to focus on serious situations. Reduces noise so analysts can study patterns where mortality is significant. Helps policymakers prioritize regions with notable death tolls.

# State with highest confirmed cases

Usefulness :- Identifies the worst-hit state in terms of infections. Enables state governments to ramp up testing, hospital capacity, and lockdown measures where they are most needed. Helps direct emergency response teams and supplies.

# Countries with the least total deaths

Usefulness :- Highlights regions that successfully prevented fatalities. Offers case studies for best practices in containment, treatment, and public compliance. Allows other countries to learn what strategies worked.

# Totals up to April 29, 2020 in India

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68330bb4-735a-4293-944a-ef20c32f4bf7)

Usefulness :- Gives a snapshot of India’s outbreak size on that date. Helps health experts track how fast cases were rising in different states. Informs the public and government about overall progress and where risks remain.
